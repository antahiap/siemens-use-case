[Through-hole technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology)Â (THT)

Through-Hole Technology (THT) is an older method for [[Electronics Assembly Techniques]] on [[Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design]] where component leads are inserted through holes in the PCB and soldered on the opposite side. 

#disciplines 
1. **Component Lead Forming**: THT components typically come with straight leads. Before assembly, the leads may need to be bent or formed to the correct shape to fit the PCB layout and hole spacing.

2. [[Component Insertion]]

3. [[Wave Soldering]]

4. **Selective Soldering**: In cases where some components cannot withstand the high temperatures of wave soldering, selective soldering is used to solder specific through-hole components while avoiding others.

5. [[THT Quality Control]]

7. **PCB Design Considerations**: PCBs designed for THT assembly must consider lead spacing, hole sizes, and component placement to ensure proper fit and solderability.

8. **Through-Hole Components**: Common THT components include connectors, switches, electrolytic capacitors, and some power components.
