The stencil used in the printing process is a metal sheet (usually made of stainless steel) with apertures or openings corresponding to the locations of the solder pads on the PCB. The stencil design is created based on:

- the PCB layout
- component footprint data. 

The size and shape of the apertures determine the amount of solder paste deposited on each pad.
