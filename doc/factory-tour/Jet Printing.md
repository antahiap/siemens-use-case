also known as inkjet printing or jet printing, is an advanced technology used in the fabrication and assembly of electronic components and devices. It is a non-contact, additive manufacturing process that utilizes inkjet printing techniques to deposit various materials, such as conductive inks, dielectric materials, and other functional materials, directly onto a substrate (e.g., printed circuit board or flexible electronics) in a precise and controlled manner. 

#advantages
- increased flexibility
- reduced waste
- faster production.

Here's an overview of electronic manufacturing jet printing:

#features
-  **Materials Deposition**: Jet printing allows the deposition of a wide range of functional materials, such as conductive inks (silver, copper), dielectric inks, solder pastes, and other materials. The materials are loaded into specialized cartridges or reservoirs in the printer
- . **Non-Contact Printing**: Unlike traditional screen printing or stencil printing, jet printing is a non-contact process. The printer's print head dispenses droplets of ink or material onto the substrate without physical contact, allowing for fine feature sizes and high precision.
- . **Layer-by-Layer Printing**: Jet printing is inherently a layer-by-layer process. Multiple passes of the print head are performed to build up the desired pattern or circuitry, layer by layer. This allows for the creation of complex three-dimensional structures
-  **Digital Control**: Jet printing is digitally controlled, enabling precise control of droplet size, volume, and placement. This level of control allows for high-resolution printing and the ability to produce intricate designs.
-  **Prototyping and Customization**: Jet printing is particularly well-suited for prototyping and small-scale production of electronic components and devices. It enables rapid design iterations and customization without the need for expensive tooling.
- . **Additive Manufacturing**: Jet printing is considered an additive manufacturing process since material is added only where needed. This reduces material waste and improves efficiency compared to subtractive manufacturing methods.
- **Post-Printing Processes**: After the printing process, additional steps such as curing, drying, or sintering may be required, depending on the type of material used. These processes help solidify and stabilize the printed features.
