[surface-mount technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology)Â (SMT)

#abb :surface mounted technology
#same_as:plannar mounting

#def : a method for  [[Electronics Assembly Techniques]] electrical components are mounted directly onto the surface of a [[Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design]] instead of[[ Through-hole technology (THT)]].


#advantages
- increased component density
- reduced manufacturing costs
- improved electrical performance

#disciplines
