- After the solder paste is printed, the stencil is lifted off the PCB, leaving a layer of solder paste on the exposed pads. 

- Excess solder paste is often collected and returned to the solder paste container for reuse.

#Challanges
- Solder Paste Bridging
- Solder Paste Stenciling: Sometimes, instead of a clean separation, the stencil may pull away from the PCB too quickly, causing some solder paste to stick to the stencil, resulting in an insufficient solder paste deposit on the pad. This issue can lead to poor solder joints and component misalignment.

- Stencil Cleanliness

-  **Stencil Aperture Shape**: The shape of the stencil apertures can affect the solder paste release. Square apertures may cause the solder paste to "dog-ear," leading to uneven solder paste distribution.

- Stencil Tension: The tension of the stencil during the printing process can influence the separation process. Too much tension can result in tearing of the stencil, while too little tension can cause misalignment and smearing.
