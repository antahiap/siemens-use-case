Quality control and inspection techniques are essential to verify the quality of the solder joints and detect any defects or issues.

#issues
1. **Insufficient Solder Paste**
2. **Excessive Solder Paste**
3. **[[Solder Balling]]**
4. **[[Tombstoning]]**
5. [[Solder Joint Voids]]
6. **[[Non-Wetting]]**
7. **Solder Bridging**
8. **Lifted Pads**: SMT components can lift or detach from the PCB due to:
	1. improper soldering
	2. mechanical stress
	3. insufficient adhesion.
9. **Solder Joint Cracks**: Cracks in solder joints can occur due to:
	1. thermal stress 
	2. mechanical shock
	3. inadequate soldering.
10. **Misalignment**:  defects such as 
	1. open joints
	2. skewed components.
11. **Insufficient Inspection**: defects may go unnoticed, leading to potential failures in the field.
