- [[Surface-Mount Technology (SMT)]]
- [[Through-Hole Technology (THT)]]

THT was widely used before the advent of Surface Mount Technology (SMT). 

#compare
- Manual Assembly: THT assembly often involves manual labor, making it more time-consuming and potentially less cost-efficient compared to SMT assembly.
-  With the emergence of SMT, THT usage has declined due to the advantages of smaller component sizes, higher component densities, and automated assembly offered by SMT. However, THT is still used in specific applications where high power or specialized components are required.
-  Reworking THT components involves desoldering and removing or replacing components. THT rework requires more effort and skill compared to SMT rework

While Through-Hole Technology is not as prevalent as it used to be, it remains an essential technique for specific applications that require 

#applications 
- robust
- high-power components 
- when SMT is not feasible.

 For modern electronics, SMT is the predominant technology due to its advantages in miniaturization, automation, and cost-effectiveness.
