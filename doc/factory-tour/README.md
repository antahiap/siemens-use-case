## Factory Tour - Personal Knowledge Graph

My self made mark downs show the topics I have studied so far. These documentation is interesting to be explored in [OBSIDIAN](https://obsidian.md/).


## Install-import

First you install it on your system, [download link](https://obsidian.md/download), and then you can choose open folder as vault and then select the `./doc/factory-tour` directory. #note the `.obsidian` directory should not exist in the selected folder.
