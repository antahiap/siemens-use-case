Process parameters refer to the settings and configurations of the [[Surface-Mount Technology (SMT)]] machines and equipment, such as:
	1. solder paste printing speed, 
	2. component placement speed,
	3. reflow oven temperature settings. 
	#important These parameters are optimized for efficient and consistent production.


 refer to the settings and configurations of the [[Through-Hole Technology (THT)]] machines and equipment, such as:
	 1. wave soldering temperature2
	 2. conveyor speed.
